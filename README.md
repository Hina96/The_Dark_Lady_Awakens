# The_Dark_Lady_awakens
"The Dark Lady awakens" is a project created at the university for the "Game Design and Prototyping" examination, in which we had to design a game based on the world of Harry Potter. This project was created by three person. 
My role was to create all the reference for pg and npg, the logo, all the digital and physical prototype (excluded the one in the main section), the Relationship Maps, the Interpersonal Circumplex, I managed the Data Organization Document,
the Enemy Chart, the character's gameplay based on Dungeon and Dragons rule, the items, the Spell Chart and the Spell Compendium and some of the section that are in the main level (the level that we exposed to examination).
The final document is the "Level-design-document.pdf", all the other files were used to compose this document and they follow the structure described in the "TeamInfo/DataOrganizationDocument/DataOrganizationDocument.pdf".
